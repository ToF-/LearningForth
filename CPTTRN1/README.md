# CPTTRN1 - Character Patterns (Act 1)
(basics)

Using two characters: . (dot) and * (asterisk) print a chessboard-like pattern. The first character printed should be * (asterisk).

##Input
You are given *t* < 100 - the number of test cases and for each of the test cases two positive integers: *l* - the number of lines and *c* - the number of columns in the pattern (*l*, *c* < 100).

##Output
For each of the test cases output the requested pattern (please have a look at the example). Use one line break in between successive patterns.

## Example
### Input:
```
3
3 1
4 4
2 5
```


### Output:
```
*
.
*

*.*.
.*.*
*.*.
.*.*

*.*.*
